# ZZSTL
  A simplified STL based on SGI-STL
  Realizing ZZSTL by simplifying SGI-STL.
  Replacing some pivotal components in STG-STL, such as "allocator", "iterator".
  However, I would complete it as a practicable one.
  
P.S.
  "ZZ" in "ZZSTL" implies poor.(Please call it "Za Za STL")
  
 Thanks for reading.
